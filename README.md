# Boundfox Studios Discord Bot

This is the official Boundfox Studios Discord Bot.

It's not a general purpose bot, but tied to the stuff we need at Boundfox Studios.

However, we decided to make it Open Source, if you want to take a look how things are working. :-)

## Setup

This bot uses denon, so please run `./install-denon.sh` first.

Then, you can you use two tasks:

* `denon start`: Starts the development server.
* `denon bundle`: Bundles the server into a ready to deploy javascript file.
